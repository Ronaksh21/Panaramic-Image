# Panaramic-Image
In this Project two images are stitched together by using Image Processing tools coded from scratch.
# The Flow for the Project is:-

1. Using SIFT Descriptors for Determining the Matching Keypoints between two images.
2. Using Ransac Algorithm to determine the maximum Inliers.
3. Getting Homography Matrix for Projections.
4. Using cv2.warpPerspective for stitching the two images together.

Saving the Final Image.
